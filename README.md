Founded in 2016, Pondering Press, Inc is a micro-publishing house dedicated to helping people learn by providing customized contract services to trainers and educators.  In 2020, Pondering Press, Inc became a registered federal 8a small business entity, capable of responding to governmental and other bids or requests.

From 2017 to 2019, the Founder and Chief Editor of Pondering Press participated in the research and development of a new kind of learning engagement system, with Imagine-Invent-Create LLC, called HALS, the Hands-on Active Learning System.  HALSMed was a prototype system that provided a proof of concept that important healthcare problems, like hospital acquired infections, could be tackled by providing authentic learning opportunities on demand.  It was demonstrated at the 2018 American Vascular Association Convention in Ohio by I-I-C and presented as a poster at the NDIA/NTSA iFEST 2019 in Arlington Virginia by Pondering Press and I-I-C.

During this time, Chief Editor Braitling also personally volunteered to work with the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee to create their first Open Standard specification which would transform the venerable SCORM eLearning system and the progressive ADL xAPI military training specification into the next generation xAPI learning management system.  Publication of the new specification is expected in 2020.
