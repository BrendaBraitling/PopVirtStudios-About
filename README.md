About Founder Brenda Braitling, MISM

From 2015 to 2016, Braitling was employed as a Data Quality Coordinator for the Florida TRADE Consortium,  funded by a $15 million TAACCCT grant obtained by St. Petersburg College, Clearwater, Florida, USA.  The Consortium of Florida state colleges and more than 200 industry partners developed and delivered more than 100 programs across 11 specialties centered on supporting training and professional development in the Advanced Manufacturing industry.  During the 4-year grant, more than 5000 participants were trained and more than 100 training programs were established across 14 colleges.  Ms Braitling became aware of the technology literacy gap, the need for aligning professional competencies to learning experiences and how modern educational technology systems could be improved.  In Summer 2016, Braitling founded Pondering Press Inc as a way to begin this work as an educational specialty publisher.

From 2017 to 2019, the Founder and Chief Editor of Pondering Press participated in the research and development of a new kind of learning engagement system, with Imagine-Invent-Create LLC, called HALS, the Hands-on Active Learning System.  The HALSMed Kiosk provided a proof of concept that important healthcare problems, like hospital acquired infections, could be tackled by providing authentic learning opportunities on demand.  HALSMed Kiosk was demonstrated at the 2018 American Vascular Association Convention in Ohio by I-I-C and presented as a poster at the NDIA/NTSA iFEST 2019 in Arlington Virginia by Pondering Press and I-I-C.  I-I-C plans to move HALSMed to production or other HALS products forward by 2021.  Pondering Press is developing HALS compatible learning and evaluation materials, including personalized training for Role Competencies as well as Organizational Policy and Procedure Development, Documentation and Compliance.

Since 2018, Chief Editor Braitling has volunteered to work on the xAPI working group of IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee to create the first IEEE Open Standard specification which would transform the venerable SCORM eLearning system and the progressive ADL xAPI military training specification into the next generation xAPI learning management system.  Publication of this new specification is expected in late 2020.  IEEE LTSC also sponsors learning technology and engineering working groups concerned with structuring professional competencies, documenting augmented reality learning experiences, assuring interoperable learning records, designing ethical and effective evaluation systems and securing authentication systems.  Braitling will utilize these Open Standards to guide development projects at Pondering Press and PopVirt Studios toward personalized learning and technological interoperability of experience documentation systems.
